## Goal
Shiba INU Lottery is the best project the SHIBA's commmunity could expect.
We will burn 10% of every ticket price, helping the community to burn tokens to reduce the max supply.
This is a lottery everyone can participate and the funds will serve to fund beautiful projects across the ecosytem.
You can rate, vote and submit new project on our website.

## How it works
Everyone holding SHIBA INU tokens can play. To play, buy a ticket on our website with your metamask wallet. 
For now, the price of a ticket is defined as 100,000 SHIBA per ticket. This can evolve in the future as we attempt to provide a decent ticket price.
You can buy as much tickets as you want. Each single more ticket provides you one more chance to win.
Every week, we will make the draw and the winner will receive the cash prize.

## Cash share
For each ticket you buy on the lottery, here is the distribution of the fees required:
- 70% for the cash prize
- 10% will be burnt
- 20% to fund the project, make it growth and fund the project you will submit to us. We will fund each semester projects with the more votes.
